INSTALLATON
------------

See index.php for installation / setup instructions.

SIMPLE TEST PLAN
----------------
Login as admin / imslti.   Make a course, make a user and enroll the user as 
Instructor in the course.  Leav admin and log in as the user.  Play with the
tools.

DEVELOPER NOTES
---------------
At the beginning of each of the module files add the following code:

require_once("../../config.php");
$context = moduleContext();
if ( ! $context->valid ) {
   die("Basic LTI Session failure ".$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);
}

This effectively logs the user in and makes a nice variable that has tons of information.
See the Test tool for a dump of the context information.

Look at the response and wall tools to see how to set up the db.php file to auto-create
your needed databases.

To make a new tool, make a new folder under the 'mod' folder and add an 'index.php' and
(usually) a 'db.php' and off you go.
